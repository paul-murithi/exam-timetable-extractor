# MKU Exam Extractor

A simple Python-based tool that extracts **your personal exam schedule** from the official MKU end-semester timetable spreadsheet.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of rows and dozens of programmes, this script filters the full timetable using **your unit codes** and produces a clean, personalized exam schedule containing:

- Course Code
- Course Title
- Exam Date
- Exam Session / Time

This project is ideal for students who want a quick way to organize their exam information.
